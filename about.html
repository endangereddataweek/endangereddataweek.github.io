      <strong>Endangered Data</strong>
      <p>Recent political events in the US have shed light on the fragility of federally produced data. In just the first few weeks of the Trump administration and 115th Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency was allegedly <a href='http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-epa-climatechange-idUSKBN15906G'>ordered to remove the climate change page from its website</a> and the House passed <a href='http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20170102/BILLS-115hres5-PIH-FINAL.pdf'> H.Res.5</a>, which specifically excludes the repeal or reform of the Affordable Care Act from mandatory long-term cost analysis. The Senate (<a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/103/text'>S.103</a>) and House of Representatives (<a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/482/text'>H.R.482</a>)  have both introduced bills mandating that "...no Federal funds may be used to design, build, maintain, utilize, or provide access to a Federal database of geospatial information on community racial disparities or disparities in access to affordable housing." While researchers, archivists, and librarians have worked hard on preserving this open data, there's little guarantee that it will survive in the event of an agency taking down a dataset.</p>

      <strong>Rescuing and preserving data</strong>
      <p>The threat to open data via political threat and unintended consequences isn't new, and scientists, archivists, and librarians have a long history of working to preserve them. However, since the November election, there has been a growing urgency for saving these datasets. The most visible of these efforts is <a href='http://www.ppehlab.org/what-is-a-datarescue-event'>DataRescue</a>, a program spearheaded by the Penn Program in the Environmental Humanities Lab, University of Michigan Libraries and Project_ARCC, holding events across the country. Contributors to this projects are scrambling to ensure that crucial governmental datasets are preserved for researchers now and in the future. Datasets are being added to ICPSR's <a href='https://www.datalumos.org/'>DataLumos</a> and <a href='https://www.datarefuge.org/'>DataRefuge</a> as a backup to federal agency servers.</p>

      <strong>Advocating for data curation and preservation</strong>
      <p>Our federal data will not be saved through one-time mass backup. We must work for strong federal open data policies and continue to shed light on threats to the collections from all sources. An annual series of events, coordinated across campuses, nonprofits, libraries, citizen science initiatives, and cultural heritage centers can shed light on public datasets that are in danger of being deleted, repressed, or lost. We must bring awareness to different types of threats to publicly available data, engage with the power dynamics involved in data creation, sharing, and retention, and to make endangered data more secure and accessible. These events can capitalize on endangered collections in DataRefuge, DataLumos and elsewhere by improving access and preservation, visualizing and publicizing the data, critically engaging with the power dynamics of data creation, retention, and sharing, encouraging political activism for open data policies, or by having workshops on data curation, documentation, and preservation.</p>
