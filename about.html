<h2>About Endangered Data Week</h2>

      <h3>Why now?</h3>
      <p>Political events in the United States have shed new light on the fragility of federally produced data. In just the first few weeks of the Trump administration and 115th Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency was allegedly <a href='http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-epa-climatechange-idUSKBN15906G'>ordered to remove</a> climate change information from its website, the USDA <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/trump-administration-blacks-out-animal-welfare-information">removed animal welfare data</a> from its website, and the House passed <a href='http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20170102/BILLS-115hres5-PIH-FINAL.pdf'>H.Res.5</a>, specifically excluding changes to the Affordable Care Act from mandatory long-term cost data analysis. The Senate and House of Representatives have both received proposed bills (<a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/103/text'>S.103</a> and <a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/482/text'>H.R.482</a>) prohibiting funding from being used "to design, build, maintain, utilize, or provide access to a Federal database of geospatial information on community racial disparities or disparities in access to affordable housing." While researchers, archivists, librarians, and watchdog groups work hard to create and preserve open data, there's little guarantee that information under federal control will survive changes to federal agencies.</p>

      <h3>Building on past work</h3>
      <p>Threats to open data aren't new, and scientists, archivists, and librarians have a long history of working to foster and preserve unfettered access to information. However, since the November election, there has been a growing urgency to save endangered datasets. The most visible of these efforts focuses on environmental data: <a href='http://www.ppehlab.org/what-is-a-datarescue-event'>DataRescue</a>, a program spearheaded by the Penn Program in the Environmental Humanities Lab, University of Michigan Libraries and Project_ARCC, holding events across the country. Contributors to this projects are scrambling to ensure that crucial datasets on climate change and related issues are preserved for researchers now and into the future. Datasets are being added to ICPSR's <a href='https://www.datalumos.org/'>DataLumos</a> and <a href='https://www.datarefuge.org/'>DataRefuge</a> as a backup to federal agency servers. Similarly, the <a href="http://eotarchive.cdlib.org">End of Term Web Archive</a> project has functioned since 2008 to "capture and save US Government websites at the end of presidential administrations." This is a web archiving collaboration between the Internet Archive, California Digital Library, University of North Texas Libraries, and Library of Congress, covering sites from all three branches of the federal government.</p>

      <h3>Working toward a culture of data consciousness</h3>
      <p>Our federal data will not be saved through a one-time mass backup. We must work for strong federal, state, and local open data policies and continue to shed light on threats to data collections from all sources. An annual series of events like Endangered Data Week, coordinated across campuses, nonprofits, libraries, citizen science initiatives, and cultural heritage institutions can shed light on public datasets that are in danger of being deleted, repressed, or lost. We must raise awareness of different types of threats to publicly available data, engage with the power dynamics involved in data creation, sharing, and retention, and work to make endangered data more secure and accessible. This week's events can amplify attention to endangered collections by: publicizing the availability of datasets; visualizing and increasing critical engagement with them; encouraging political activism for open data policies; or by fostering data skills through workshops on curation, documentation, improved access, and data preservation.</p>

      <h3>Who are we?</h3>
      <p>Spearheaded by Brandon Locke, Jason A. Heppler, and Sarah Melton and inspired by <a href="https://www.datarefuge.org">DataRefuge</a> and events like <a href="http://www.bannedbooksweek.org">Banned Books Week</a> and <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org">Open Access Week</a>, this project quickly gained the attention and support of the <a href="https://diglib.org">Digital Library Federation</a> and its new interest group on <a href="https://www.diglib.org/transparency-accountability/">Government Records Transparency/Accountability</a>, led by Rachel Mattson. Additional contributors include Purdom Lindblad, Kristen Mapes, Anna Kijas, and (for DLF) Bethany Nowviskie, Wayne Graham, Katherine Kim, and Becca Quon.</p>
