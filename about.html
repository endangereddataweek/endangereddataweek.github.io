<h2>About Endangered Data Week</h2>

      <h3>Why now?</h3>
      <p>Political events in the United States have shed new light on the fragility of publicly administered data. In just the first few weeks of the Trump administration and 115th Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency was allegedly <a href='http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-epa-climatechange-idUSKBN15906G'>ordered to remove</a> climate change information from its website, the USDA <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/trump-administration-blacks-out-animal-welfare-information">removed animal welfare data</a> from its website, and the House passed <a href='http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20170102/BILLS-115hres5-PIH-FINAL.pdf'>H.Res.5</a>, specifically excluding changes to the Affordable Care Act from mandatory long-term cost data analysis. The Senate and House of Representatives have both received proposed bills (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/103/text">S.103</a> and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/482/text">H.R.482</a>) prohibiting funding from being used "to design, build, maintain, utilize, or provide access to a Federal database of geospatial information on community racial disparities or disparities in access to affordable housing." While researchers, archivists, librarians, and watchdog groups work hard to create and preserve open data, there's little guarantee that information under federal control will always survive changes to federal agencies.</p>

      <h3>Building on past work</h3>
      <p>Threats to open data aren't new, and archivists, librarians, and researchers have a long history of working to foster and preserve unfettered access to information. Events like <em><a href="http://sunshineweek.rcfp.org">Sunshine Week</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org">Open Access Week</a></em> highlight similar issues to the scholarly community and the press. The <a href="http://eotarchive.cdlib.org">End of Term Web Archive</a> project has functioned since 2008 to "capture and save US Government websites at the end of presidential administrations" as a collaboration between the Internet Archive, California Digital Library, University of North Texas Libraries, and Library of Congress, covering sites from all three branches of the federal government. However, since the November election, the urgency to address endangered datasets has been felt more deeply and by a larger community. The most visible effort (and an <em>Endangered Data Week</em> partner) focuses on environmental data: <a href="http://www.ppehlab.org/what-is-a-datarescue-event">#DataRescue</a>/<a href="https://www.datarefuge.org">DataRefuge</a>, a program spearheaded by the Penn Program in the Environmental Humanities Lab, University of Pennsylvania Libraries, and <a href="https://projectarcc.org">Project_ARCC</a>. Contributors to this project are scrambling to ensure that crucial datasets on climate change and related issues are preserved for researchers now and into the future. Datasets are being added to ICPSR's <a href='https://www.datalumos.org/'>DataLumos</a> and <a href='https://www.datarefuge.org/'>DataRefuge</a> as a supplement to federal agency servers. Meanwhile, censorship fears are driving the Internet Archive to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/29/13778188/internet-archive-of-canada-backup-trump-surveillance-censorship">pursue backup strategies</a> outside the United States of America.</p>

      <h3>Toward a culture of data consciousness</h3>
      <p>Our public data will not be saved through a one-time mass backup, nor by distributed and uncoordinated, small acts of heroism. And, as the research data management community well knows, privately administered data is also under threat, often of benign neglect. We see <em>Endangered Data Week</em> as a service to projects like those listed above, and to the broader community of people who care about access to information. Together, we must: work for strong federal, state, and local open data policies; increase data skills and competencies among students and colleagues; and continue to shed light, year after year, on threats to data collections from all sources. An annual series of events, coordinated across campuses, nonprofits, libraries, citizen science initiatives, and cultural heritage institutions and spanning disciplines and types of datasets can shed light on public information that is in danger of being deleted, repressed, mishandled, or lost. Through this project, we hope to: raise awareness of different types of threats to publicly available data; engage with the power dynamics involved in data creation, sharing, and retention; foster concrete skills and collaborative projects; and highlight work to make endangered data more secure and accessible.</p>

      <h3>Who are we?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/brandontlocke/status/826939862368518144">Spearheaded</a> by Brandon Locke, in collaboration with Jason A. Heppler, Bethany Nowviskie, and Wayne Graham, and inspired by events like <a href="http://www.bannedbooksweek.org">Banned Books Week</a> and <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org">Open Access Week</a>, this project quickly gained the attention and support of the <a href="https://diglib.org">Digital Library Federation</a>'s new interest group on <a href="https://www.diglib.org/transparency-accountability/">Government Records Transparency/Accountability</a>, led by Rachel Mattson. Additional contributors include Sarah Melton, Purdom Lindblad, Kristen Mapes, Anna Kijas, and (for DLF) Katherine Kim and Becca Quon. <a href="https://www.datarefuge.org">DataRefuge</a>, <a href="https://science.mozilla.org">Mozilla Science Lab</a>, the <a href="http://ndsa.org">NDSA</a>, and <a href="https://www.clir.org">CLIR</a> join the <a href="https://diglib.org">DLF</a> as project sponsors.</p>
