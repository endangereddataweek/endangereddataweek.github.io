The Digital Library Federation’s new working group on Government Records Transparency and Accountability will present a webinar on “the current state of FOIA, the difference between ‘records’ and ‘data,’ and what, actually, is at risk in this current moment.” A group viewing will be held at McKeldin Library Room 6103 and will allow for participants to engage in post webinar discussion with representatives from the University Libraries. The webinar will be hosted at https://www.uberconference.com/clir-dlf.
