ICPSR has established an open-access archive, DataLumos (www.datalumos.org), where the public can archive valuable government data resources, ensuring their long-term availability. ICPSR, a center within the University of Michiganâ€™s Institute for Social Research, has joined widespread efforts to preserve valuable US government data that may be hard to find or inaccessible in the future. 

On Tuesday, February 27, 2018 from approximately 1:00-1:30PM EST, ICPSR will be hosting a webinar as part of Endangered Data Week. This half-hour webinar will discuss ways in which you can use this resource and steps you can take to improve data accessibility into the future. Participants can expect to learn about this tool, how to use it, and how it can benefit their future work.
