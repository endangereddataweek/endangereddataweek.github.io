Are you worried about the availability and preservation of publicly accessible data? Boston College will be hosting an event to pull data.gov data & metadata for BC grants from the NEH, IMLS, NEA, and other federal agencies. NEA, NEH, and IMLS data was identified specifically because there are already a number of efforts underway to preserve science and climate change data, but no visible effort to do the same for humanities and performing arts data.
