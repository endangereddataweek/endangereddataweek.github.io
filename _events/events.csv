Would you like to save your research, publications, syllabi, and datasets for long term preservation somewhere safe? Do you want to connect with colleagues from across the Humanities and beyond? Humanities Commons is an expansion of MLA Commons and is open to anyone.

Participants of this workshop will learn about the basic functions of Humanities Commons, see examples, and set up their own account. They will learn specifically how to:

1) Set up an account and create a profile
2) Join groups and create a group
3) Deposit work into CORE, the subject repository for scholarly materials
4) Create a website using built in Wordpress functionality
