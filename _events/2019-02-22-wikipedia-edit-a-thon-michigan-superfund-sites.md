Interested in learning more about Wikipedia? Want to actively affect social change and support environmental sustainability? Join us for an environmental awareness Wikipedia Edit-a-thon. We'll be improving Wikipedia's coverage of Michigan Superfund sites--polluted locations around the state that have been flagged for long-term clean up efforts. This workshop will equip you with the tools you need to begin editing in Wikipedia, contributing edits that make a difference. All levels of Wikipedia experience are welcome.
