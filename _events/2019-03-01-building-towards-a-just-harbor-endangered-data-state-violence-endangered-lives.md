The Government Records Transparency and Accountability interest group is happy to present the Endangered Data Week 2019 signature webinar. This year, our webinar is titled “Building Towards a Just Harbor: Endangered Data, State Violence, & Endangered Lives". This webinar will feature a panel of speakers that will present on projects that use or critique governmental data, highlighting in particular the ways in which these types of data may be used to investigate or draw attention to state violence. 

Our panel will feature the following speakers:

•Manan Ahmed, Associate Professor, Department of History, Columbia University & the Torn Apart / Separados project 

Title: Mobilized Humanities and Crisis: Torn Apart/Separados
Abstract: What are scholarly best-practices to create an agile, responsive community? How does one make sure the standards of transparent data, minimal computing, privacy are maintained? Ahmed will reflect from his experiences, as part of the Group for Experimental Methods, on the ways in which scholars can collaborate in response to political or natural crisis in an engaged and ethical way. The praxis for dealing with endangered archives needs even more acute clarity in the case of an immediate crisis.

•Gabriel Solis, Executive Director, Texas After Violence Project

Title: Documenting State Violence: (Symbolic) Annihilation & Archives of Survival
Abstract: The personal stories and experiences of victims and survivors of state violence are critical counter-narratives to dominant discourses on violence, criminality, and the purported efficacy of retributive law enforcement and criminal justice policies and practices. They compel us to engage with complex questions about victimhood, disposability, and accountability; they also confront and challenge the social, cultural, and ideological power of symbolic annihilation. Because these counter-narratives are under constant threat of being suppressed, co-opted, or silenced, they are forms of endangered knowledge that must be protected and preserved. 

•Stacy Wood, School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh

Title: Historical police data practices and current data priorities
Abstract: US law enforcement agencies have, for over a century, produced and published a great deal of data about crime, but gathering data on the behaviors and actions of both individual officers and agencies as a whole remains difficult and ad-hoc. This presentation seeks to place current efforts at gathering and using data about police against the historical backdrop of police data practices. What can the ways in which police think about and collect information tell us? 

Presentation titles and abstracts forthcoming.

Event was held online from 2-4 PM EST.
