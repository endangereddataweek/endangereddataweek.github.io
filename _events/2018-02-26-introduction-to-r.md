Designed for the absolute beginner, this workshop provides a gentle introduction to R and RStudio. R is a free, open-source software environment and programming language designed specifically for statistical analysis. Since its introduction in 2000, R has rapidly increased in popularity thanks to its power, price (free!), and supportive community. RStudio is a free integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using and learning R much easier. In this workshop weâ€™ll get you started using R with RStudio, show you how to import data, do some basic data manipulation, create a few graphics, perform some basic statistical analyses, and point you in the direction to learn more and go further with R!
