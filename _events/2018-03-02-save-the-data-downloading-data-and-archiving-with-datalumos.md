In recognition of Endangered Data Week, ICPSR’s DataLumos project will be hosting an afternoon of data saving. We will welcome data users, community members, and University of Michigan faculty, staff and students to join us to download, document, and archive data into DataLumos. The Federal government has long been a source for valuable data, used by academic researchers, community groups, and informed citizens for a variety of purpose. However, the mission of these government agencies isn’t data preservation. Luckily, ICPSR has been a leader in data archiving for decades. The DataLumos project was created to ensure that valuable data will be available today, tomorrow, and years from now. DataLumos is a crowd-sourced project, allowing data users to archive the publicly-available data they value. 

This event will be a concentrated, in-person manifestation of that crowd-sourced spirit—interested individuals coming together with a common purpose of preserving data for the future…with tasty snacks too! Participants are encouraged to come for part or all of the event, and while some computers will be available, participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops. No specialized software is needed—just a web browser.

To prepare for the event: Think of a dataset you want to ensure is available in the future and can work on saving.
