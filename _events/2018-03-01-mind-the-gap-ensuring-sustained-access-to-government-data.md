As part of Endangered Data Week we explore the very real scenario of a government shutdown. What does that mean for data access, discovery, and our daily lives? How can we as citizens take steps to prepare for such instances? Efforts to preserve essential federal data are ongoing across the country, and here we will explore one avenue that individuals can use.

Attendees will learn to archive a data set via open data repository DataLumos (https://www.datalumos.org/).

This is an interactive session, participants should bring a laptop if possible.
