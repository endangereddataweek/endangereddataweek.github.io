The "digital revolution" in archaeology has brought with it a number of exciting opportunities.  From GPS to laser scanners and sophisticated databases, archaeologists can now utilize with relative ease a number of new data collection tools that promise to speed and simplify our research.  A somewhat less glamorous but equally important advantage of the digital age concerns our ability to scan and share large quantities of paper-based legacy documents kept in archaeological archives around the world.  This presentation reviews some of the challenges faced by a team of researchers here at MSU as they develop a new metadata scheme to as part of the digitization of an excavation archive at the Ohio State University Excavations at Isthmia in Greece.
