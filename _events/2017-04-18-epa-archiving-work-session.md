Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI) is hosting an in-person and remote Archivers meetup to preserve EPA data.

We'll pick up reviewing what has been archived at previous Data Rescue events before beginning to document downloaded material that needs metadata! We'll use agency primers to help direct our work (https://envirodatagov.org/event-toolkit/).

If you are in Toronto, ON, join us at Civic Tech Toronto for 6:30pm, this week hosted at Myplanet  252 Adelaide St E.

Remote participants welcome! Just join Archivers contributors slack https://archivers-slack.herokuapp.com/ and introduce yourself in #introductions!
