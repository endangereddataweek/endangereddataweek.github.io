Publicly available data is essential to research and its existence is threatened. Join us for some pizza in our new visualization studio to discuss the types of threats we are seeing and how we can work to ensure long-term preservation of and access to data. We will be joined by Rachel Leventhal-Weiner, Data Engagement Specialist from the Connecticut Data Collaborative. This is part of Endangered Data Week 2018, created by the Digital Library Federation.
