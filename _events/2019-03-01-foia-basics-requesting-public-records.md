The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows anyone to request access to U.S. government records. Even as some government data is increasingly available as open data, FOIA continues to be a critical tool for researchers, journalists, activists, lawyers, and other curious people. But filing requests and getting results can be more an art than a science. This workshop will cover the basics of federal and state freedom of information laws, how to get started making requests, and use of the online tools Muckrock and FOIA Mapper.  This workshop is offered as part of Endangered Data Week.
