All digital files are vulnerable to decay and loss. Sometimes a hard drive fails or a file becomes corrupted. But we can also lose files due to bad data management habits, obsolete technology, or, paradoxically, because we have too many copies and too many storage options. It is easy to overlook the digital photos, documents, and other files we create in daily life, in our personal research, and in our citizen science and historian scholarship. This workshop helps participants identify their most valuable computer files and create a plan for backup, self-curation, and preservation. Side effects may include improved ability to find and share files, and more restful sleep at night.
