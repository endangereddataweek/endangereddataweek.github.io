In honor of Endangered Data Week, join us for an introduction to DocNow, a tool and community developed around supporting the ethical collection, use, and preservation of social media content.  Scholarsâ€™ Lab staff and fellows will be on hand to provide a brief introduction to the tool, a discussion of data collection, and a consideration of the complex, often fraught, stories that can be told through social media data. All skill levels are welcome and encouraged to attend. Refreshments will be served!
