The objective of Open Data is to eliminate burdens to access data created or managed by government agencies, while respecting privacy and sensitivity concerns. It enables entrepreneurs, academics, community groups, other learning communities, developers, and interested citizens to use data in creative data applications. The City of Charlottesvilleâ€™s Open Data Portal houses machine-readable data, that can be downloaded and manipulated. The data includes crime statistics, traffic, demographics, real estate and environmental data. Members of the Open Data Advisory Group, a citizen stakeholder group, will introduce the Open Data hub and portal, and then Nathan Day will lead us in a dive into some of the data available from the portal.

Please bring a laptop so you can dive into the data as well.
