This presentation will focus on some simple, practical steps you can take to try and prevent endangering your personal and research data. First, how to name and organize your files and folders generally. Second, a simple overview of how to organize datasets in database structures. Third, what file formats live the longest. Lastly, what kind of back-ups work best in different situations. The emphasis of this presentation is everyday steps that can become routine, but could save your data from extinction and make it easier to share your data with fellow researchers.
