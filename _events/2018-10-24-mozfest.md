Endangered Data Week (EDW) is a project that helps communities collect, maintain, and use data for good. Our community is especially interested in helping people protect and preserve “endangered” data -- data in danger of being deleted, repressed, mishandled, or lost due to social, technical, or political issues. In this session, we'll share a scenario and dataset (inspired by real endangered data) with participants and invite them to problem solve how they might save and steward that data away from erasure or misuse. We'll use participants' responses to set up a closing discussion about how all of us can help our communities work for better data consciousness, civic literacy, and government transparency.
