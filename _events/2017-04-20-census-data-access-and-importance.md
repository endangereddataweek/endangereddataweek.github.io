Join us for a lunch-time conversation with David Drozd, Research Coordinator
for the University of Nebraska at Omaha's Center for Public Affairs Research. His talk will cover data changes threats, including the results when Canada turned their Census survey from mandatory to voluntary, plus how sample sizes drive accuracy, the need for non-governmental data portals and what researchers relied on when the 2013 U.S. government shutdown occurred. Drozd will also discuss race and ethnicity questions, including how the Census and Office of Management and Budget defines such categories. He will also explore how the sample size of the American Community Survey annual data release focuses on geographies with 65,000+ population, and why other communities have five year surveys.

Lunch will be provided for attendees.
