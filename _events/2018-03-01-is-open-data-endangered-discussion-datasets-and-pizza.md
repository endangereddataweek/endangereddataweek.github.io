What is endangered data? 
How can we begin to think about the long-term preservation of and access to data? 
Come visit the new visualization studio in Babbidge library as we discuss these questions and enjoy pizza together! 
This event takes place as part of Endangered Data Week 2018, created by the Digital Library Federation.  The mission of Endangered Data Week is to raise awareness of threats to publicly available data, publicize the availability of datasets, and increase community engagement with these datasets.
Rachel Leventhal-Weiner, Data Engagement Specialist from the Connecticut Data Collaborative will be attendance to talk about access to public data and the importance of data literacy for community engagement.
This event organized and sponsored by Research Data Services from UConn Library.   The Data Management and STEM Librarians at UConn are Jennifer Chaput and Renee Walsh.  We look forward to seeing you there!
