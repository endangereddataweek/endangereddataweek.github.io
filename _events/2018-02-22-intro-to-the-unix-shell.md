The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it’s a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so they aren’t typing the same things over and over again. This workshop will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.  No prior experience is necessary - please bring a laptop to participate.  Please register, as space is limited.
