Literate statistical programming can improve the efficiency and reproducibility of our research. This workshop explores tools for weaving code, results, and interpretation into integrated documents in Stata. We will consider default solutions bundled with Stata 15, as well as community-created alternatives. We will also illustrate multiple output formats (e.g., .html, .tex, .pdf). Prior knowledge of markdown is helpful but not required. Presented by Alex Jakubow.
