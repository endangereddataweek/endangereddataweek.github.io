Let our elected representatives know we care about access to government data sets. Write them a postcard, letter, or email and make your voice heard. Drop by the Research Help Area on the first floor of Bertrand Library on Friday, April 21st anytime between 2-4 PM.  We will provide a shared space, moral support, and the materials for you to get in touch with your representatives, congressional committees, and the heads of federal departments.  Let them know that we value free and open access to government data!
