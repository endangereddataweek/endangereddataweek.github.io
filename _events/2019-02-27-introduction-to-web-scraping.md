What is web scraping?  Why should you use it? Is it legal?  How hard is it to learn? These questions and more will be explored (and answered) in this introductory workshop. This workshop will cover the tools, hows, and ethics of web scraping, and provide a hands-on example using the Python programming language.  All are welcome.  No previous programming experience is required.
This workshop is offered as part of Endangered Data Week.
