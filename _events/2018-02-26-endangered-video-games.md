The Digital Scholarship Commons at the University of Victoria Libraries is hosting an "endangered video game" event in the main foyer of the library. Students will be invited to play video games on a series of Apple II computers, as well as "Duck Hunt" on an original Nintendo console (which also requires an old television set). We will raise awareness about what it means to preserve "data" in the 21st century, including but not limited to the preservation of hardware, software, and the files themselves. We will have a poster about what "Endangered Data" is and will hand out trifolds that outline how students can protect their own data. The ETCL has donated USB thumb drives with which we will teach students how to encrypt external drives.
