Hosted at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, this panel discussion will feature scholarly representatives from a variety of departments across campus addressing the question: What is the scope and impact of endangered data? This diverse panel will provide insight into the different individual, institutional, and national considerations that are germane to active data preservation in an age of uncertain data persistence and stewardship.
