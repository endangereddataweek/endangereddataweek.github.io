This workshop will introduce participants to methods for submitting effective FOIA-based requests for government data and documents. Led by investigative reporter — and experienced FOIA-submitter — Filiberto Nolasco Gomez (Editor of Workday Minnesota/Labor Education Service), this workshop will offer participants a rare hands-on opportunity to learn the nitty gritty skills needed to effectively conduct research using the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. Filiberto will also help students think about where to publish the information they are pursuing.
