As a part of Endangered Data Week (February 26-March 2), students can drop in to explore Chicago government data, specifically the Civilian Office of Police Accountability dataset through the Chicago Data Portal (https://data.cityofchicago.org/). 

This workshop will introduce students to the data portal, the ways government data can be endangered, and how to use the SoQL query language. There is no experience necessary for this introductory workshop.
