As part of Endangered Data Week, we're hosting an afternoon of "data awareness" on Friday, April 21, 2017. As an official government documents repository we take our role as data stewards very seriously. We'll be focusing the state of data and how we can be more involved in efforts to make data more accessible and secure. We'll be screening two webinars, discussing data preservation initiatives around the country, and sharing Vassar's plans to be part of those initiatives.

Webinars:
"Endangered Accountability: A DLF-Sponsored Webinar on FOIA, Government Data, and Transparency"

"Raising Awareness and Engaging Your Community Through Data Rescue" https://www.fdlp.gov/component/rseventspro/event/266-raising-awareness-and-engaging-your-community-through-datarescue
