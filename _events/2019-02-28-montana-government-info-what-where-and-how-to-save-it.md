Government information is "boring” whines the unaware.  Au contraire!  Government information is the basis of most news stories. Jim Kammerer, State Publications Librarian, will share how the Montana State Library identifies, acquires, preserves, and provides permanent public access to digital state government information intended for public distribution.  Includes an online tour of the state publications repository, a collection of archived state agency websites, and a little-known compilation of state government databases from all 50 states.  Finally, in the spirit of Endangered Data Week, attendees will learn how to single-handedly rescue web content at risk of extinction.
