Two concurrent workshops will be offered on Friday. Coffee and light refreshments will be available in the morning.

8:30 am – 12:30 pm

Workshop 1: Friendly Introduction to GitHub
Instructor: Stephanie Wright, Mozilla Science Lab
Helpers: Jessica Gallinger, Simon Fraser University; Danielle Robinson, Oregon Health & Science University; Steve Van Tuyl, Oregon State University
Registration fee $25

Heard of GitHub but don’t think it’s relevant to your world? Did you know it can actually be used as a pretty powerful project management tool that doesn’t require coding or a command line interface? Let us show you how to use GitHub to manage programs and projects with no prerequisite knowledge required in a Friendly Introduction to GitHub workshop.

During this 4-hour workshop we will provide examples of how this flexible tool can be used for managing all sorts of collaborative projects from creating a website to managing events and other offline projects up to managing multiple projects across an entire team or program. We will demystify the lingo and processes built into this online platform. A significant portion of the time will be hands-on activities and small-group work where we will create repositories, work with labels, setting milestones and assigning tasks. We will also take some time to look at the tools complementary to GitHub such as gh-pages and gitbook. Participants will need to bring a laptop to participate in hands-on activities.

9:00 am – 4:00 pm (lunch and afternoon break included)

Workshop 2: Building and Utilizing Rubrics for Assessment of Data Management Plans
Instructors: Amanda Whitmire, Stanford University; Jake Carlson, University of Michigan Library; Susan Wells Parham, Georgia Institute of Technology; Brian Westra, University of Oregon
Made possible by funding from IMLS

With an increasing number of funding agencies implementing data management plan (DMP) requirements, there is a growing need for robust tools to enable standardized, qualitative and quantitative reviews of these plans. This workshop will empower you to create rubrics for the structured assessment of data management plans (DMPs), and will explore how assessments can be used to inform the development or evolution of research data services. We will spend the morning reviewing a range of approaches to reviewing DMPs, with an emphasis on rubrics, and discuss what has been learned from these efforts. We will also share how findings from DMP assessments can inform the evolution of local data services. The afternoon session will focus on the development and use of rubrics as an assessment tool for formal DMP review. The creation of an effective rubric for reviewing a data management plan is not as simple as converting guidance language into assessment criteria. We will share unexpected challenges that we encountered and suggest ways to address them when they arise. We will shift our focus from National Science Foundation DMPs and provide you with time and training to apply our methods to the funding agency of your choice. There will be ample opportunity for attendees to practice developing an analytic rubric to assess sample DMPs for adherence to newly mandated funder guidelines. You will leave the workshop with the knowledge and training that you need to create an assessment rubric for any type of DMP.

After completing the workshop, attendees will be able to:

Describe the utility of rubrics for evaluating data management plans, and how to apply results in a local context;
Develop a new analytic rubric for the assessment of data management plans that are based on funding agency guidelines, and;
Utilize an analytic rubric for standardized assessment of data management plans
