Led by instructors from the University Libraries and the iSchool, this hands-on workshop will provide a basic introduction to digital preservation and the tools used to create sustainable data preservation workflows. Participants are encouraged to bring their own datasets, however instructors will have test data sets that can be used for experimentation.

Please note: This is a technical workshop that requires a computer and a basic level of computer literacy. While some topics will be more advanced than others, some tools can be easily deployed by most any user. Please contact Joseph Koivisto (jkoivist@umd.edu) if you have any questions.

Tools discussed in this session will include:

♦ Georgetown University Libraries’ File Analyzer - https://georgetown-university-libraries.github.io/File-Analyzer/
♦ AVPreserve’s Fixity - https://www.avpreserve.com/tools/fixity/
♦ OpenRefine - http://openrefine.org/
♦ Library of Congress’s BagIt - https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python
