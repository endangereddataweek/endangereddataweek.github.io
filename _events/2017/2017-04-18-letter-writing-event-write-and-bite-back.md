Spend your lunch break advocating for better data collection policies and for better access to government data!

A few recent topics to discuss:

Environmental Protection Agency was allegedly ordered to remove climate change information from its website
USDA removed animal welfare data from its website
Senate and House of Representatives have both received proposed bills (S.103 and H.R.482) prohibiting funding from being used “to design, build, maintain, utilize, or provide access to a Federal database of geospatial information on community racial disparities or disparities in access to affordable housing.”
Lack of mandatory reporting of hate crimes to the FBI
Lack of a federal database of officer-involved shootings or citizens killed by police
Drop by LEADR (112 Old Hort) on Tuesday, April 18 any time between 12:00p and 1:30p to take part.

We will provide lunch, space and materials to get in touch with your representatives in Congress, heads of federal departments, and local and state politicians to let them know that you value open government data!
