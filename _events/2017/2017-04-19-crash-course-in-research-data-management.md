Have you ever lost a project file? Been unable to find the most recent version of a document? Suffered hard drive failure or had your laptop stolen? Been unable to open old files? Been told your data management plan wasnâ€™t detailed enough? Forgotten which file was which? Even small research projects can generate enough data and digital material to become confusing and vulnerable to loss. Start your next project (or class) out with a plan to keep your project organized and your data safe, from inception until you are ready to share, reuse, or revisit the project whether next month or years from now. This workshop will provide strategies and insights for managing your data for effective collaboration, to meet funder requirements, or to preserve it for reuse or sharing in the future.
