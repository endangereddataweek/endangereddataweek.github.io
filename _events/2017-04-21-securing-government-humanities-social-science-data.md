This closed meeting organized by the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) gathers approximately 30 participants--humanities scholars, social scientists, librarians, archivists, and data/information scientists--to discuss the status of social science/humanities (HSS) government data in the context of recent data rescue efforts. The meeting will explore the characteristics of HSS data, examine the nature of their risk, and outline needs for securing HSS data moving forward.  SSRC will share outcomes with the public.
