A panel of Linguistics faculty and graduate students will discuss a position paper on reproducible research in linguistics. The panel will consider the role of reproducibility in increasing verification and accountability; associated implications for how linguistic data are managed, cited, and maintained for long-term access; and mechanisms for evaluating “data work” in academic hiring, tenure, and promotion processes.
