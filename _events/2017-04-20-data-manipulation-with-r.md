This hands-on workshop will introduce the basics of tidying data in R. Rather than run the risk of research questions being wedged into a tool rather than the tool fitting the research, we will look at the ways the R language can be used to clean and tidy data for analysis. The workshop will introduce participants to the basics of data manipulation, the dplyr and tidyr packages, and the grammar of data manipulation. No prerequisite software is required; a version of RStudio will be provided to participants via a server.
