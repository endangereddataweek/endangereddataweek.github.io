Please plan to join us for an update on the latest activities and lessons learned across our network. Trying to keep up with the current status is a challenge for all of us!

During this webinar, you will...

hear from colleagues about the work they are doing,
learn how your ideas and input can help inform the May Meeting in DC, and
ask questions that can help all of us as we address the challenges of preserving federal data and making it accessible to our communities now and in the future.
The URL will be sent to registered participants on April 18.

Hope to see you online!
