Story Maps are templates that allow authors to give context to their ArcGIS Online maps. Whether telling a story, giving a tour or comparing historic maps, ESRI Story Maps are easy-to-use applications that create polished presentations. ArcGIS Online sessions assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. Presented by Drew Macqueen.
