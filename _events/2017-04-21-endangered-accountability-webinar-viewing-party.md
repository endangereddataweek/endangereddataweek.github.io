Join members of the Digital Library Federation's new working group on Government Records Transparency and Accountability for a live conversation about government data and records transparency. This webinar will dig below the headlines to talk about the current state of FOIA, the difference between “records” and “data,” and what, actually, is at risk in this current moment. Featuring presentations by Alex Howard of the Sunlight Foundation, Denice Ross from New America, and Deputy Director Nikki Gramian and Management Analyst Amy Bennett from the National Archives FOIA Ombudsman’s Office. Join at https://www.uberconference.com/clir-dlf or in the viewing room in Love Library 224.
