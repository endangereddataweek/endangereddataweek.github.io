In light of recent legislation regarding how our browsing information may be collected by our internet service providers, there has been a lot of talk about internet privacy. If you're hearing about VPNs, browser tracking, and more, but aren't sure what concrete steps you can take, this workshop can help.

For best results, bring your own laptop and/or phone so you can adjust settings on your own devices.
