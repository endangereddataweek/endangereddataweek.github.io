Scholars work with a vast amount of research materials — including primary and secondary source texts, quantitative data, audiovisual materials, spreadsheets, and miscellaneous notes, code, etc. This workshop will cover approaches to naming, organizing, and storing these materials that make them easier for you to find, reference, and ultimately publish. It will also cover topics like file formats and metadata conventions to make sure that the data or supplemental materials that accompany your own scholarship are able to be reused and preserved. This workshop is intended for scholars in the humanities and social sciences.
This workshop is offered by Stanford Libraries' Center for Interdisciplinary Research as part of its mission to provide training in technical academic research practices and applied research methods.
