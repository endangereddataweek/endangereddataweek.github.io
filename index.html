      <p>Recent political events in the US have shed light on the fragility of federally produced data. In just the first few weeks of the Trump administration and 115th Congress, data about racial disparities, animal welfare, and the climate were put at risk of deletion through Congressional bills and alleged executive mandates. The threat to open data via political threat, data loss, and mismanagement isn't new, and scientists, archivists, and librarians have a long history of working to preserve them. However, since the November election, there has been a growing urgency for saving these datasets. Through efforts like <a href='http://www.ppehlab.org/what-is-a-datarescue-event'>DataRescue</a>, mass amounts of data at risk of deletion have been backed up, providing safe keeping from political threats as well as incidental loss and benign neglect. To ensure long-term collection and access of these valuable datasets, we must work for strong federal open data policies and continue to shed light on threats to the collections from all sources. Endangered Data Week intends to do this through an annual series of events, coordinated across campuses, nonprofits, libraries, citizen science initiatives, and cultural heritage centers that shed light on public datasets that are in danger of being deleted, repressed, or lost. <<a href='/about/'>Read more about Endangered Data</a>></p>
