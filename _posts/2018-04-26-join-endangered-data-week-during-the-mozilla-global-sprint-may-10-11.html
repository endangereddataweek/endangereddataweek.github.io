<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong><span class="magee-dropcap dropcap" style="color:;">W</span>e’re</strong> excited to announce that </span><a href="http://endangereddataweek.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Endangered Data Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (EDW) is participating in the upcoming </span><a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mozilla Global Sprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on May 10th and 11th, 2018. We’re writing to invite you to join in and participate!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mozilla Global Sprints are community events designed to support the development of open projects for a healthy internet. They are meant to be fast-paced, fun, and collaborative. During this year’s sprint, EDW plans to develop a user-friendly toolkit of endangered data-related tutorials and resources—we will collect materials created by organizers of past Endangered Data Week events and also generate new materials that event organizers can use in developing future Endangered Data Week events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s an EDW Global Sprint </span><a href="https://github.com/endangereddataweek/resources/blob/master/global-sprint-2018.md"><span style="font-weight: 400">primer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with more info. Additional details, as well as a place to chat and ask questions during the Sprint, is in the </span><a href="https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/endangereddataweek"><span style="font-weight: 400">EDW Etherpad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You are invited to join in and participate no matter what your skill set, time commitments, or experience! We are looking for librarians, archivists, journalists, scholars, artists, lawyers, data scientists, educators, and others; people with experience in teaching, writing, coding, design; as well students and learners of all kinds—anyone who’s passionate about the preservation of digital information, data, and records. You can choose to help for 10 minutes, a few hours, or two full days; and you can participate onsite at one of our EDW sprint locations (in Omaha, East Lansing, and Boston) or remotely. Check out our evolving list of ways to contribute to the toolkit </span><a href="https://github.com/endangereddataweek/resources/issues"><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. And please feel free to reach out to us if you have additional ideas for materials we should add to the toolkit or any questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All that’s missing is you! Come join us!  </span></p>
