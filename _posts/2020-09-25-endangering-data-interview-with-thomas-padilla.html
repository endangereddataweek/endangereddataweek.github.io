<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tell us a bit about your projects and how you became interested in cultural heritage data and algorithmic and AI approaches to curation and research?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300">I am interested in cultivating GLAM community capacity around responsible, ethically grounded computational engagement with data. Some of that interest has to do with positionality &#8211; me being a mixed race, first generation college student, from a working class background. I’m constantly trying to find ways for my labor to address historic and contemporary marginalization.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 300">Always Already Computational: Collections as Data</span></i><span style="font-weight: 300"> was an Institute of Museum and Library Services supported effort that iteratively developed a range of </span><a href="https://collectionsasdata.github.io/resources/"><span style="font-weight: 300">deliverables</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300"> meant to spark capacity around principles-driven creation of computationally amenable collections . In that work I was very lucky to be joined by Laurie Allen, Stewart Varner, Hannah Frost, Elizabeth Russey Roke, and Sarah Potvin. With a better sense of community need I later embarked on </span><a href="https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/"><i><span style="font-weight: 300">Collections as Data: Part to Whole</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 300"> &#8211; an effort supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 300">Part to Whole</span></i><span style="font-weight: 300"> is essentially a regranting and cohort development program. Hannah Scates Kettler, Stewart Varner, Yasmeen Shorish, and I are currently </span><a href="https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/cohortone/"><span style="font-weight: 300">working with 12 institutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300"> (large R1s, historical societies, museums, State-based digital libraries, and more) to develop models that guide collections as data production and models that help organizations develop sustainable services around collections as data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300">Over the course of 2019 I worked as a Practitioner Research in Residence at OCLC Research, interviewing and holding convenings for professionals within and outside of libraries in the United States. This work culminated in the community research agenda </span><a href="https://www.oclc.org/research/publications/2019/oclcresearch-responsible-operations-data-science-machine-learning-ai.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 300">Responsible Operations: Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI in Libraries</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 300">. I felt a lot of pressure to get this work right. I did not want to write some breathless utopian endorsement of AI. Any success I have in that regard is due to the wisdom of the community, any failures are mine. The library community in the United States feels like it has reached a certain level of awareness regarding the pitfalls of AI, helped considerably by the work of </span><a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/"><span style="font-weight: 300">Safiya Noble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300">, practitioners like </span><a href="https://www.montana.edu/news/18360/msu-researchers-receive-grant-to-build-algorithmic-awareness-as-form-of-digital-literacy"><span style="font-weight: 300">Jason Clark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300">, and an understanding that library community practices have long </span><a href="https://www.fordhampress.com/9780823276363/cruising-the-library/"><span style="font-weight: 300">held the potential to systematically impact communities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300"> in a discriminatory manner. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rummanchowdhury.com/"><span style="font-weight: 300">Rumman Chowdhury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300"> introduced me to the concept of responsible operations which was a perfect way to encapsulate where it feels like we are as a community. A number of us want to use AI to strengthen library services but only if it doesn’t compromise commitments to cultivating a more equitable society. Of course, no community is uniform in their beliefs, and libraries are no exception. Some at junior and senior levels have quietly &#8211; and not so quietly &#8211; expressed the view that preoccupation with responsibility or ethics is orthogonal to progress and allows the library community to be beat in some imagined race with the private sector. These are dangerous views and the stakes are real. We must act accordingly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For years, many in the library and cultural heritage world have critiqued digitization efforts as replicating (or even accelerating) long-standing biases that center on white, male, and US/Eurocentric collection patterns, viewpoints, and catalog descriptions. In both the </span><a href="https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Santa Barbara Statement on Collections as Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the </span><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3152935#.X2PPmdZlBTY"><span style="font-weight: 400">Always Already Computational: Collections as Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> final report, you and your partners have pointed to a crucial need for critical engagement with biases and shortcomings and an intention to address the needs of vulnerable communities represented in the materials. What are some examples of these approaches that you’ve found to be successful?</span><span style="font-weight: 300"><br />
</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 300">Collections as Data: Part to Whole </span></i><span style="font-weight: 300">requires that regrantees demonstrate capacity to serve underrepresented communities &#8211; a consideration that spans thematic coverage of the collection in question, community buy-in, and a demonstrated commitment to ethical principles that work against the potential for harm. Examples of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 300">Part to Whole </span></i><span style="font-weight: 300">work addressing your questions include but are not limited to Kim Pham’s effort at the University of Denver to develop a </span><a href="https://specialcollections.du.edu/cad/form/termsOfUse"><span style="font-weight: 300">terms of use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300"> for collections as data and Amanda Henley and Maria Estorino’s effort at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill to </span><a href="https://onthebooks.lib.unc.edu/about/"><span style="font-weight: 300">discover and increase access to Jim Crow laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300"> and other racially-based legislation in North Carolina between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300">More broadly, there is so much good work being done. I am super inspired by Dorothy Berry’s advocacy at Harvard, resulting in a </span><a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/07/houghtons-2020-21-digitization-focus-black-american-history/"><span style="font-weight: 300">2020-2021 exclusive focus on the digitization of Black American History</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300">. I am inspired by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance’s </span><a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care"><i><span style="font-weight: 300">CARE Principles</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 300">, co-led by Stephanie Russo Carroll and Maui Hudson. A response to the </span><a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/"><i><span style="font-weight: 300">FAIR Principles</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 300">, CARE </span></i><span style="font-weight: 300">problematizes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 300">FAIR’s, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 300">“focus on characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials and historical contexts.”</span><span style="font-weight: 300"> A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 300">CARE </span></i><span style="font-weight: 300">principle like indigenous “Authority to Control” presents a difficult and needed challenge to the cultural heritage community. What could it look like for more institutions to relinquish control of collections to their rightful owners? It is not often the case that capital &#8211; stolen or not &#8211; is returned and I imagine even the most well meaning libraries will struggle mightily within their own hierarchies to make this happen. I appreciate Eun Seo Jo and Timnit Gebru’s effort to </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3351095.3372829"><span style="font-weight: 300">bridge the archives community and machine learning community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300">. Attempts to thread the needle on cross-domain work is always tough but it is definitely needed.  T-Kay Sangwand’s </span><a href="https://kula.uvic.ca/articles/10.5334/kula.36/"><i><span style="font-weight: 300">Preservation is Political: Enacting Contributive Justice and Decolonizing Transnational Archival Collaborations</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 300"> is a must read. </span><a href="https://michellecaswell.org/research"><span style="font-weight: 300">Michelle Caswell’s work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300"> &#8211; as a whole &#8211;  is fundamental to improving efforts in these spaces. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In your </span><a href="https://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/publications/2019/oclcresearch-responsible-operations-data-science-machine-learning-ai.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Responsible Operations: Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI in Libraries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> report, you cite Nicole Coleman’s suggestion that, in regard to machine learning, libraries might be better served to “manage bias” rather than attempt (or claim) to eliminate it. Can you talk a little bit more about that framing and why you feel it’s productive in the library world?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300">I think people heard enough from me about it in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 300">Responsible Operations. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 300">I encourage folks to read Nicole’s subsequently published article, </span><a href="https://journal.calaijol.org/index.php/ijol/article/view/162"><i><span style="font-weight: 300">Managing Bias When Library Collections Become Data</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 300">. </span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What do you think the role for library and information professionals is in larger conversations about “endangering data” and algorithmic and data justice?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300">I think there are many of us doing this work. While former Illinois University Librarian </span><a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED318475.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 300">Paula Kaufman’s testimony before Congress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300"> (pg. 77) against a Federal surveillance program gives me chills every time I read it, I often end up thinking about what combination of colleagues, mentors, institutional culture, and personal and professional ethics were in place to make that act of bravery possible. That naturally leads to thinking about what it would take to cultivate similarly principled acts, large and small, among my colleagues. That seems like a promising road to head down. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is there anything else you want to add, or any work or other projects you want readers to know about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300">I appreciate the opportunity to share thoughts during Endangered Data Week. In addition to the people and projects mentioned above, I encourage folks to check out the </span><a href="https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/986506/"><i><span style="font-weight: 300">Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence Position Paper</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 300">; Mozilla’s recent work on </span><a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/data-futures/"><i><span style="font-weight: 300">Data for Empowerment</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 300">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 300">and Ruha Benjamin’s incredibly powerful </span><a href="https://youtu.be/TrEiEjjt7v4?t=880"><span style="font-weight: 300">Data4BlackLives keynote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300">. </span></p>
