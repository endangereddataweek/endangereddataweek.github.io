<p><strong><span class="magee-dropcap dropcap" style="color:;">W</span>e're</strong> excited to announce that <a href="http://endangereddataweek.org/">Endangered Data Week</a> (EDW) is participating at the<a href="https://mozillafestival.org">Mozilla Festival</a> on October 28, 2018. If you're in London this week, we'd love to see you!</p>

<p>Mozilla Festival is a seven day celebration for, by, and about people who love the internet, showcasing world-changing ideas and technology through workshops, talks, and interactive sessions.</p>

<p><a href="https://guidebook.com/guide/147793/event/21682616/">In our session</a>, we'll share a scenario and dataset (inspired by real endangered data) with participants and invite them to problem solve how they might save and steward that data away from erasure or misuse. We'll use participants' responses to set up a closing discussion about how all of us can help our communities work for better data consciousness, civic literacy, and government transparency.</p>

<p>Please feel free to share this announcement with anyone else in your communities and networks who might be interested in participating.</p>
