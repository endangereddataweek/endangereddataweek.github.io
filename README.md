# Endangered Data Week

A static site, [http://endangereddataweek.org/](http://endangereddataweek.org).

## Develop

This is a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) site.

1. clone this repository and `cd` into the `csvconf.com` directory
1. run the `bundle` command
1. run `bundle exec jekyll serve -w`

If everything worked, you should now have a local server running at http://localhost:4000. The `w` flag means the server will watch for changes and rebuild, so you can edit the site as needed and see the updated version in your browser right away.
